# Bottom-Up Top-Down Attention for Image Captioning and Visual Question Answering (pytorch implementation)
---

This repository aims on implementing this CVPR2018 paper:
![Bottom-Up and Top-Down Attention for Image Captioning and Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07998)
using PyTorch.

For simplification, region detection is done using YOLOv3 and only the image captioning model is implemented.
